# Purpose?

A simple HTTP server that queries the coronavirus vaccination page [here](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/),
and informs the current age range that can apply.

For now, "eligible" will count as true once the age limit is less than 30.
